We define the SupportHandler interface with a handleRequest method to handle support requests.

Concrete handlers (HardwareSupportHandler, SoftwareSupportHandler, NetworkSupportHandler) implement
the SupportHandler interface and handle requests based on their types.

Handlers are organized in a hierarchical order, with each handler having a reference to the next handler in the chain.

The HelpDeskTicketingSystem class creates the chain of responsibility by linking the handlers in the desired order.

We test the system by creating sample support requests and passing them through the chain of responsibility.

This design allows different types of support requests to be handled by different support teams in a hierarchical manner,
as required by the Chain of Responsibility pattern.
